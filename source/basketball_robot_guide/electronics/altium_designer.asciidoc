== Project

=== Creating a project

* File -> New -> Project...
* In *Create Project* window set project name (for example picr21-team-<your team name>-mainboard) and select project folder.

=== Adding schematic file

* Right click on *.PrjPcb -> Add New to Project -> Schematic

=== Adding PCB file

* Right click on *.PrjPcb -> Add New to Project -> PCB

=== Adding schematic library file

* Right click on *.PrjPcb -> Add New to Project -> Schematic Library

=== Adding PCB library file

* Right click on *.PrjPcb -> Add New to Project -> PCB Library

=== Saving project

* Right click on *.PrjPcb -> Save
* One option to name the files in the project is to use the projects name.
For example if project is named picr21-team-one-mainboard.PrjPcb, then schematic would be named picr21-team-mainboard.SchDoc.

== General

* Press *Space* while moving objects to rotate them.
* Press *X* while moving objects to mirror them in X axis.
* Press *Y* while moving objects to mirror them in Y axis.
* Drag from left to right to select objects that are fully inside the selection box.
* Drag from right to left to select objects that are at least partially inside the selection box.

== Creating components

=== Creating component footprint

. Find a dimensional drawing for the component's package.
Usually package drawings are located at the end of the component's datasheet.
. Open *.PcbLib file.
. Tools -> IPC Compliant Footprint Wizard...
. Select *Component Type* (for example PQFP which is used by the recommended microcontroller) and press *Next*.
. Change *Overall Dimensions* based on the datasheet and press *Next*.
. Change *Pin Dimensions* based on the datasheet and press *Next*.
. Add Thermal Pad if necessary and press *Next*.
. *Use calculated values* for *Heel Spacing* and press *Next*.
. *Use default values* for *Solder fillets* and press *Next*.
. *Use calculated component tolerances* and press *Next*.
. *Use Default Values* for *IPC tolerances* and press *Next*.
. *Use calculated footprint values* for *Footprint Dimensions* and press *Next*.
. Silkscreen line width can be 0.2 mm. Press *Next*.
. Use defaults for *Courtyard, Assembly and Component Body Information* and press *Next*.
. *Use suggested values* for *Footprint Description* and press *Next*.
. Select *Current PcbLib File* for *Footprint Destination*.
Select *Produce 3D/STEP model* to create 3D model of the component.
Also select *Embedded*.
Press *Finish*.
. Press *Ctrl + S* to save the PCB library.

=== Creating component symbol

. Open *.SchLib file.
. In *Properties panel* set
.. *Design Item ID* (for example STM32G441KxT)
.. *Designator* (for example U?)
.. *Comment* (for example STM32G441KxT)
. Pins of the symbol can be placed individually with Place -> Pin
or in a bigger batch with Tools -> Symbol Wizard...
. Pin names can be found in the datasheet.
. Try to arrange the symbol such that the center of symbol is at 0 coordinates.
. Symbols typically have a rectangle in the middle of the symbols, which is created automatically by Symbol Wizard.
.. A rectangle can be placed with Place -> Rectangle
.. If the rectangle is covering the pins,
then it can be moved below the pins with selecting Edit -> Move -> Send To Back
and clicking on the rectangle.
. When the symbol is finished, then press *Add Footprint*
.. In the *PCB Model* window press *Browse...* and select the footprint created for the component.
. Press *Ctrl + S* to save the Schematic library.

== Schematic

=== Placing components

. Open *.SchDoc file.
. Open *Components panel*
. Select *.SchLib from the dropdown.
. Drag the component on the schematic or right click on it and select Place.
. Symbols for some other components can be found from *Manufacturer Part Search panel*.
. Symbols for power are available on the top toolbar.

=== Connecting components

* Press Ctrl + W or use Place -> Wire to activate Wire tool.

=== Net labels

. Select Place -> Net label to place net labels.
. Place net labels on the wires to change the name of the wire.
** Wires with the same net labels are connected together.

== PCB design

=== Importing schematic changes to PCB design

. Open *.PcbDoc file.
* Use Design -> Import Changes From <your project name>.PrjPcb

=== Rules

* Open Rules with Design -> Rules...

=== Changing units

* Press *Q*
** Units can be checked in the bottom left corner.
** Millimeters are recommended for the PCB.

=== Changing grid

* In the schematic document:
** Press *G*
** Active grid is shown at the bottom left next to the coordinates.
** It's recommended to use 100 mil grid for components and wires as the symbols are created for that grid size.
Sometimes it's useful to use finer grid when creating schematic symbols
or moving reference designators and component values.
* In PCB layout document:
** Press *G* and select suitable grid size from the list.
** Good grid size for most of the layout is 0.1 mm.
0.025mm might work better for smaller components and thin tracks.
1mm grid is useful for changing board size.

=== Changing board size

. Press *1*
. Select Design -> Edit Board Shape
. Press *2* to go back to PCB layout editing.

=== Opening 3D PCB view

* Press *3*

=== Hiding rooms

. Press *L* to open *View Configuration*.
. Open *View Options* tab.
. Press on the eye icon next to the "Rooms".

=== Changing layer stackup

. Open stackup editor with Design -> Layer Stack Manager...

=== Routing traces

* Press Ctrl + W to start routing.

=== Repouring polygons

. Select **T**ools -> Poly**g**on Pours -> Repour **A**ll
** Shortcut: T -> G -> A
