Also select *Embedded*.
Press *Finish*.
. Press *Ctrl + S* to save the PCB library.

=== Creating component symbol

. Open *.SchLib file.
. In *Properties panel* set
.. *Design Item ID* (for example STM32G431KBT6)
.. *Designator* (for example U?)
.. *Comment* (for example STM32G431KBT6)
. Pins of the symbol can be placed individually with Place -> Pin
or in a bigger batch with Tools -> Symbol Wizard...
. Pin names can be found in the datasheet.
. Try to arrange the symbol such that the center of symbol is at 0 coordinates.
. Symbols typically have a rectangle in the middle of the symbols, which is created automatically by Symbol Wizard.
.. A rectangle can be placed with Place -> Rectangle
.. If the rectangle is covering the pins,
then it can be moved below the pins with selecting Edit -> Move -> Send To Back
and clicking on the rectangle.
. When the symbol is finished, then press *Add Footprint*
.. In the *PCB Model* window press *Browse...* and select the footprint created for the component.
. Press *Ctrl + S* to save the Schematic library.

== Schematic

=== Placing components

. Open *.SchDoc file.
. Open *Components panel*
. Select *.SchLib from the dropdown.
. Drag the component on the schematic or right click on it and select Place.
. Symbols for some other components can be found from *Manufacturer Part Search panel*.
. Symbols for power are available on the top toolbar.

=== Connecting components

* Press Ctrl + W or use Place -> Wire to activate Wire tool.

=== Net labels

. Select Place -> Net label to place net labels.
. Place net labels on the wires to change the name of the wire.
** Wires with the same net labels are connected together.

== PCB design

=== Importing schematic changes to PCB design

. Open *.PcbDoc file.
* Use **D**esign -> **I**mport Changes From <your project name>.PrjPcb

=== Rules

* Open Rules with **D**esign -> **R**ules...

=== Changing units

* Press *Q*
** Units can be checked in the bottom left corner.
** Millimeters are recommended for the PCB.

=== Changing grid

* In the schematic document:
** Press *G*
** Active grid is shown at the bottom left next to the coordinates.
** It's recommended to use 100 mil grid for components and wires as the symbols are created for that grid size.
Sometimes it's useful to use finer grid when creating schematic symbols
or moving reference designators and component values.
* In PCB layout document:
** Press *G* and select suitable grid size from the list.
** Good grid size for most of the layout is 0.1 mm.
0.025mm might work better for smaller components and thin tracks.
1mm grid is useful for changing board size.

=== Changing board size

. Press *1*
. Select Design -> Edit Board Shape
. Press *2* to go back to PCB layout editing.

=== Opening 3D PCB view

=== Repouring polygons

. Select **T**ools -> Poly**g**on Pours -> Repour **A**ll
** Shortcut: T -> G -> A

=== Routing traces

* Press Ctrl + W to start routing.

=== Changing layer stackup

. Go to https://jlcpcb.com/impedance for stackup descriptions.
+
Recommended 4-layer stackup from JLCPCB is *JLC04161H-3313*.
It costs the same as the default one (JLC04161H-7628), but has smaller distance between adjacent layers,
which is helpful for reducing crosstalk.
+

+
Dielectric constants for materials used by JLCPCB can be found here:
https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/263-User-Guide-to-the-JLCPCB-Impedance-Calculator
. Open stackup editor with **D**esign -> Layer Stack Manager...
. Select *Top Layer* and press *Add*.
+
image::../images/altium_stackup_step_1_top_layer_press_add.png[]
. Select *Below*, *Signal* and make sure that *Include Dielectrics* is selected.
Press *Ok*.
+
image::../images/altium_stackup_step_2_add_inner_layers.png[]
. Change *Thickness* and dielectric constant (*Dk*) values based on JLCPCB specifications.
Rename Layer 1 and Layer 2 as Layer 2 and Layer 3.
Change copper weight of *inner layers* to *1/2oz*.
Change *Dielectric 1* type to *Core*.

=== Controlled impedance

==== Using Altium Designer's impedance calculator

. Open stackup editor with **D**esign -> Layer Stac**k** Manager...
+
image::../images/altium_impedance_profile_step_1_open_impedance_tab.png[]
. Press **Add** to create new impedance profile.
+
image::../images/altium_impedance_profile_step_2_press_add.png[]
. On *Properties* panel change *Type* to *Differential* and *Target Impedance* to *90*.
90 Ohms is the differential impedance of USB differential pairs.
+
image::../images/altium_impedance_profile_step_3_properties_differential_90.png[]
. Change *Trace Gap* for each layer to 0.2mm.
Can be narrower or wider if needed.
Same differential impedance can be achieved with different trace widths and gaps.
Also on *Properties* panel change *Covering (C2)* (Soldermask thickness above traces) to *0.6mil (0.01524mm)*.
JLCPCB has specified soldermask thickness values on this page: https://jlcpcb.com/impedance.
+
image::../images/altium_impedance_profile_step_4_trace_gap_and_soldermask_thickness.png[]
. Manually round trace widths.
This is not required, but sometimes useful on a dense board or if you like rounder numbers.
+
image::../images/altium_impedance_profile_step_5_trace_width_rounding.png[]
. Save changes.
. Open schematic (*.SchDoc).
. Add net labels to differential pair signals with *_P* suffix for positive signal and *_N* suffix for negative signal.
It's possible to specify different suffixes in Project Options, but there is probably no real need for that.
Enclose net labels in a *Blanket* and add a *Differential Pair* directive so that it touches the blanket.
It's possible to add separate Differential Pair directive to both nets,
but it's easier to specify common parameters with a blanket.
+
image::../images/altium_differential_pair_schematic.png[]
. Select the Differential Pair directive
and on the *Properties* panel add *Diff. Pair Net Class* named DIFF_90 for example.
+
image::../images/altium_differential_pair_add_class.png[]
. Save changes.
. Open *.PcbDoc.
. Import schematic changes with **D**esign -> **I**mport Changes From <your project name>.PrjPcb
. Open Rules with **D**esign -> **R**ules...
. Right click on *Differential Pairs Routing* and select *New Rule...*
+
image::../images/altium_differential_pair_add_routing_rule.png[]
. *Name* the rule as *DiffPairsRoutingDIFF_90*.
Under *Where The Object Matches* select *Diff Pair Class* and *DIFF_90*.
Activate *Use Impedance Profile* and select *D90*.
Press *OK* to apply changes and close the rules.
+

==== Using manufacturer's impedance calculator

Another option, if a PCB manufacturer has an impedance calculation tool available,
is to enter the calculated values manually to the rule.
JLCPCB has an impedance calculator available here:
https://jlcpcb.com/pcb-impedance-calculator/

. Open the https://jlcpcb.com/pcb-impedance-calculator/[impedance calculator].
. Change the input parameters and press Calculate.
Calculated trace width on the outer layers for a 90-Ohm differential impedance
with a 0.2mm gap and JLC04161H-3313 stackup is 0.1575mm:
+
image::../images/jlcpcb_impedance_calculator_90_ohm_differential.png[]
. Trace width and gap values can be used to define a differential pair routing rule.
+
image::../images/altium_differential_pair_routing_rule_parameters_manual.png[]

=== Routing differential pairs

. Open *.PcbDoc
. Position components so that the differential pair traces can be as straight as possible.
If there are other components or traces close to the differential pair traces,
try to move them further away.
+
image::../images/altium_differential_pair_routing_component_positioning.png[]
. Start routing with Ro**u**te -> Interactive D**i**fferential Pair Routing (Shift+Ctrl+W or U -> I).
To reduce impedance discontinuities and intra-pair skew:
try to avoid bends,
avoid using vias if possible or reduce the amount of vias
and Keep traces as symmetrical as possible.
+
image::../images/altium_differential_pair_routing_inital_traces.png[]
. If needed, adjust traces manually to reduce stub lengths.
This can be done with regular routing (Ro**u**te -> Interactive Rou**t**ing [Ctrl+W or U -> T])
and some manual deleting and moving of the traces.
