=== NUCLEO modifications

There are jumper resistors and solder pads on the NUCLEO board that are used to connect some microcontroller pins to pin headers.
Firmware uses some pins differently from the default jumper configuration.
Necessary modifications are shown in <<image_nucleo_jumpers>>.
0 ohm resistors marked as SB2 and SB3 should be removed and jumper pads marked as 8 and 11 should be soldered together.
Alternatively SB2 and SB3 resistors can be soldered onto jumper pads 8 and 11.

=== Firmware

==== Version history

*v1.0.0*

. Initial implementation of 3 wheel motor and 1 thrower motor speed control.

*v1.1.0*

. Added failsafe to stop all motors when no commands have been received for 0.5 seconds.

==== Binary firmware file

link:https://github.com/ReikoR/picr21-basketball-robot-guide/raw/master/source/electronics/picr21-NUCLEO-adapter-firmware_v1_1_0.bin[picr21-NUCLEO-adapter-firmware_v1_1_0.bin]

Connect NUCLEO to a computer and drag or copy the *.bin file on the NOD_G431KB drive.

==== Sending commands to mainboard

Struct in firmware

[source,c,tabsize=2]
----
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) Command {
  int16_t speed1;
  int16_t speed2;
  int16_t speed3;
  uint16_t throwerSpeed;
  uint8_t disableFailsafe; // 1 to disable failsafe, anything else to enable
  uint16_t delimiter;
} Command;
----

Using with python's link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html[struct library]

[source,python,tabsize=4]
----
disable_failsafe = 0

struct.pack('<hhhHBH', speed1, speed2, speed3, thrower_speed, disable_failsafe, 0xAAAA)
----

==== Receiving data from mainboard

Struct in firmware

[source,c,tabsize=2]
----
typedef struct Feedback {
  int16_t speed1;
  int16_t speed2;
  int16_t speed3;
  uint16_t delimiter;
} Feedback;
----

Using with python's link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html[struct library]

[source,python,tabsize=4]
----
actual_speed1, actual_speed2, actual_speed3, feedback_delimiter = struct.unpack('<hhhH', received_data)
----

==== Thrower speeds

Thrower speeds are sent to thrower motor controller using
https://dmrlawson.co.uk/index.php/2017/12/04/dshot-in-the-dark/[DShot protocol].
Speed values are between 48 - 2047 for 0 to 100% speed.
