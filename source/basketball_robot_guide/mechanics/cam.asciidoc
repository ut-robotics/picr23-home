= Fusion 360 CAM

== Intro

To mill out your parts from plastic sheet,
we need to generate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code[G-code] for the milling machine.
This can be achieved with Fusion's *MANUFACTURE* feature.
This document describes most important properties and methods how to prepare your designs for milling.

== Starting

To start creating a CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) job for your design,
you should select *MANUFACTURE* from left upper menu.

Now you should see new toolbar with different CAM related tools:

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_manufacture_workspace_toolbar.png[]

Create a Manufacturing Model (MILLING -> SETUP -> Create Manufacturing Model)
to make a model that you can edit without affecting the original model.

If you have a multipart assembly you can use the "Arrange" functionality from Fusion 360 preview features
to automatically arrange and flatten the assembly.

A video tutorial on how to enable and use the "Arrange" functionality can be found here: +

== Job setup

First thing to do is to create a new setup for your job.
For this, choose SETUP -> New Setup from toolbar.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_new_setup.png[]

You should now set stock properties and origin point (the point where the milling starts).
Usually the starting (work zero) point should be in the bottom left corner of your part on top of the stock.
Z axis should point up, X and Y axis should point along the sides of your part.
Correct orientation can be chosen by selecting relevant properties under Work Coordinate System (WCS).
Depending on how the design is oriented, you might need to select different options.

Another important thing here is to set stock offsets to 0 on the Stock tab.

Now you can click OK, and you have created your first setup for milling job.

== Drilling

Drilling should usually be the first operation.
This can reduce toolchanges, since other operations are done with milling bits.

Create new drilling operations from the toolbar DRILLING -> Drill.

Select or create a tool.
Change the Spindle Speed and Plunge Feedrate if necessary.
Refer to the tools table below.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_drill_tool.png[]

Select the *face* of one of the holes.
Same size holes can be included by selecting *Select Same Diameter*.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_drill_geometry.png[]

On the heights tab, change the *Feed Height Offset* to 1mm.
This helps to save time since drilling does a lot of movements in z-axis direction and (plunge) feedrate is rather slow.

If the drilled holes do not start from the top of the remaining stock, change *Top Height From* to *Stock top*.
Otherwise the drill will be plunged too fast into the uncut material.

Select *Drill Tip Through Bottom* and add small *Break-Through Depth*,
if drilling all the way through the material.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_drill_heights.png[]

On the Cycle tab select *Cycle Type* to be *Chip breaking - partial retract* or *Deep drilling - full retract*.
Those types help to avoid plastic from getting stuck in the hole and starting to melt.

== Pocket

Pocket operation can be used when you need to mill something that does not go all the way through the material.

If you need to cut all the way through, then prefer 2D contour operation.
Contours do not cut all the material inside a profile and take less time because of that.

First select a flat end mill as the cutting tool and adjust the speeds and feeds if necessary.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_pocket_tool.png[]

Select bottom edge for *Pocket Selection*.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_pocket_geometry.png[]

Heights can be usually left unchanged.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_pocket_heights.png[]

On the *Passes* tab, change *Tolerance* to 0.01, if not using finishing passes.

Select *Multiple Depths*.
Default value of 1 mm works well for *Maximum Roughing Stepdown*.
Cutting too much material in one pass can result in bad surface finish or the tool can break under load.

Uncheck *Stock to Leave* or use small negative *Radial Stock to Leave* if you need looser fit.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_pocket_passes.png[]

On the *Linking* tab, uncheck *Lead-In (Entry)* and *Lead-Out (Exit)*.
Change *Ramp Type* to *Plunge*.
Plastic is soft enough to not require more gradual ramping.

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_pocket_linking.png[]

== 2D contours

Use contour operation if you need to cut all the way through the material,
you need to remove some material from the edge of the existing part,
or you need to cut a something that has the same width as the tool.
Although you should probably use slot operation for the latter case.

Most of the same settings apply to the contour operation as for the pocket operation.

When selecting the contour edge make sure that the arrow is outside the part.
The arrow shows the side of the cut.
To change the side, click on the arrow.

For outer or larger inside contours select *Tabs* from Geometry settings.
Tabs help to keep the parts in place.
Loose parts can get in the way of the tool, which can damage the parts and break the tool.
Tabs are usually not needed for small inside contours.

== Checking the results

Now that you have created your CAM job, you can quickly check it for any obvious mistakes.
Simulating helps with that.
Not only does it tell you, how long the job will take,
but allows you to see exactly how it will start to cut the material.
Simulation can be opened from right click menu of the setup or operation(s).

image::../images/fusion_360_cam_simulation.png[]

Turn on *Stock* and go to the end of the simulation to find any unexpected or missing cuts.
The yellow and red lines are movement and blue lines are the cutting paths.

If there are any unexpected cuts being made with non-blue line,
then try to uncheck *Keep Tool Down* in the operation settings on the Linking tab.

== Tool settings

=== Fusion 360 DigiLab tools library

You can import the file below into Fusion 360.

link:digilab_stepcraft_tools.json[Tools library file]

*Material: Polycarbonate*

Plastics work better with higher feedrates.
At low feedrates the material might start to melt
from excessive heat generated by the tool spending too much time in one place.

Following settings are good starting points that have been used before.
Reduce feedrates by around half for smaller features like inner contours.

== Optimizations

=== Order of operation

Generally move from inside the part to outside.
Cutting from outside first can mean that the part comes loose and the inside features can't be cut.

Example order:

. Drilling
. Pockets
. Inside contours
. Outside contours

=== Tool size

Largest available diameter tool size should be used based on smallest inner radius of the milled parts.
Larger diameter tools are more rigid and can remove more material in the same time.

=== Machining time

. Check machining time from right click menu on setup or operation.
. Try to avoid cutting too much material.
* Cutting large pockets with a small tool can take a lot of time.
. Try to reduce part count and complexity.
. Reduce the *Feed height* for operations that use a lot of z-axis movements, like drilling.
. Using the least amount of different tools allows to save time by avoiding tool changes.
* One option is to design inner radiuses to be as large as possible to avoid using smaller diameter tools.
. If different tools have to be used then it is recommended to order the operations
by grouping together those that use the same tool.

=== Multiple designs with single job

If same thickness material is used for different designs or same design needs to milled out multiple times,
then it is possible to save time by creating an assembly from those designs and single CAM job for the entire assembly.
Parts should be placed flat next to each other with enough space between them,
so that tool used for outer contour fits between them.
For example when using 3 mm endmill,
there should be at least 3 mm of space between parts to avoid cutting into the part next to the one being milled.

Use joints to place the parts in the assembly. Parts should be on the same plane.

Inspect stock height from setup's settings.
If all the parts have the same thickness, then stock height should not be larger than thickness of the parts.
