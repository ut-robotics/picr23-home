= Follow ball with the test robot

. Replace `PrintingMotion` with your created `OmniMotionRobot` motion class.
. Transfer the logic from `PrintingMotion` to `OmniMotionRobot`
so that you can send the rotation speed to the mainboard. No need to drive forward or backwards.
. Test the solution with the instructors and a mainboard.
Iterate on the solution in case deficiencies are brought up by instructors.
*You may need to adjust the speed directions due to motor polarity.*
. When everything appears to work, test the whole solution on an actual robot.
It should be capable of rotating towards the ball on the field.
. Congratulations!
You have created the code for your (first) basic robot.
