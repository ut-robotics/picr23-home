= Follow ball with the test robot

. Replace `TurtleOmniRobot` with your created `OmniMotionRobot` motion class.
. Transfer the logic from `TurtleOmniRobot` to `OmniMotionRobot`
so that you can send the calculated motor speeds to the mainboard.
. Test the solution with the instructors and a mainboard.
Iterate on the solution in case deficiencies are brought up by instructors.
*You may need to adjust motor angels or the speed directions due to motor installation order and polarity.*
. When everything appears to work, test the whole solution on an actual robot.
It should be capable of driving to a ball on the field.
. Congratulations!
You have created the code for your (first) basic robot.
