= Follow ball with TurtleOmniRobot

. Replace the `TurtleRobot` motion class with `TurtleOmniRobot`.
The new class allows the robot to more closely emulate the real command structures used in the robot.
. A robot uses 3 omni wheels to move about.
These wheels allow the robot to move in any direction but using them requires a bit of maths.
Familiarise yourself with the maths here:
xref:../../basketball_robot_guide/software/omni_motion.asciidoc[Omni motion guide].
. Implement the `move(self, x_speed, y_speed, rot_speed)` method using existing code in `TurtleOmniRobot`.
Calculate the speeds for three motors.
. Send the calculated speeds to the simulation method to visualise the motion vector for the robot.
. Use code from the previous tasks to test and validate your omni motion calculations.
Both `TurtleOmniRobot` and `TurtleRobot` classes.
They should behave similarly.
. Demo your solution to the instructors.
Iterate on the solution in case deficiencies are brought up by instructors.
. If everything works, continue to the next task.
