= Send commands to mainboard to rotate a motor

. Select a serial communications library for Python and install it.
As an example `PySerial` works well.
. Serial communications under Ubuntu require some permission adjustments. +
Run these commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo usermod -a -G tty robot
sudo usermod -a -G dialout robot
----
and then *log out and in*.
Without this, opening a serial port won't work without sudo permissions.
. Open the cloned repository in your IDE.
. Use `motion.py` as an example and create the class `OmniMotionRobot` that implements the `IRobotMotion` interface.
.. Create the new class `OmniMotionRobot` that extends `IRobotMotion`.
.. Add implementations for the `open` and `close` methods.
Use `TurtleRobot` as an example.
Consider that you should be able to define what port the serial connection should be created for.
.. Define a new method for sending commands to the mainboard over serial.
Refer to xref:../../basketball_robot_guide/electronics/test_robot.asciidoc[Test robot page]
for a detailed explanation of the command structure and how to assemble a command.
.. Test your code to validate that you can connect to and disconnect from the mainboard.
.. *In case of issues, debug and ask instructors for help.*
.. Connect the mainboard to the computer and check that the mainboard is wired to a motor driver correctly.
It should be able to control motors.
.. Use your created functionality to control the motors.
*Tell the motor to spin with a speed of 20 and after 2 seconds, reverse its direction.*
. Show your progress to an instructor.
. If everything works, you can continue to the next step. In case of issues, consult with instructors.
