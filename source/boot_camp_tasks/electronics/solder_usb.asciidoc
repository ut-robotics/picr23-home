= Solder USB connector with hot air

. Cover surface mount pads with solder.
Try to keep the amount of solder relatively low and equal height on all the pads.
. Add some soldering flux onto pads.
. Place connector on the pads.
. Start heating the connector with hot air.
Make sure to move the hot air nozzle around above the connector to heat it evenly.
Try with the temperature around 300 - 350 degrees.
. When the solder has melted the connector should drop closer to the PCB.
Keep heating the connector for a little longer to make sure that all the solder has melted.
. Let the solder cool a bit.
. Inspect solder joints under the microscope.
If any of the pins are not connected, it might be possible to solder them with a soldering iron.
Otherwise it might be easier to desolder the connector with hot air and try the procedure from the start.
. Solder the through hole pads with a soldering iron.
Be careful not to get any solder into the connector.
. Clean the PCB in the ultrasonic cleaner.
