= Send commands to mainboard with HTerm

. Use bench power supply to power the boards.
. Download HTerm.
** https://www.der-hammer.info/pages/terminal.html
. Connect a micro USB cable to the mainboard.
. Open HTerm.
. Select the correct port.
** On Windows the ports are listed in the Device Manager.
** On Linux running `dmesg` can list recently connected devices.
. Leave other settings to defaults.
. Press Connect.
. Command structure can be found on the
xref:../../basketball_robot_guide/electronics/test_robot.asciidoc[Test robot page].
. In `HTerm` under `Input control` change `Type` to `HEX`.
. Send `0A 00 0A 00 0A 00 00 00 00 AA AA` to set all the motors to rotate at the speed of 10.
** Byte order is little endian, which means that least significant byte is first.
. Send `F6 FF F6 FF F6 FF 00 00 00 AA AA` to set all the motors to rotate at the speed of -10.
** Negative values are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement[two's complement] of the positive value.
. 10 is relatively low speed, so if any of the motors is rotating fast,
the motor power wires might need to be reversed
(because the encoder values need to count in a positive direction if the speed is set to a positive value)
or the encoder signal connections might be faulty.
