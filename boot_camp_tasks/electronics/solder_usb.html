<li>
<p>Cover surface mount pads with solder.
Try to keep the amount of solder relatively low and equal height on all the pads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some soldering flux onto pads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place connector on the pads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start heating the connector with hot air.
Make sure to move the hot air nozzle around above the connector to heat it evenly.
Try with the temperature around 300 - 350 degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the solder has melted the connector should drop closer to the PCB.
Keep heating the connector for a little longer to make sure that all the solder has melted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let the solder cool a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspect solder joints under the microscope.
If any of the pins are not connected, it might be possible to solder them with a soldering iron.
Otherwise it might be easier to desolder the connector with hot air and try the procedure from the start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solder the through hole pads with a soldering iron.
Be careful not to get any solder into the connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clean the PCB in the ultrasonic cleaner.</p>
