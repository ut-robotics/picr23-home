<li>
<p>Find a piece of 18 AWG wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strip about 5 mm of insulation from each end of the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightly twist the strands of the wire at each end to prevent the strands from separating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some flux to the ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover the ends with some solder.
Make sure to evenly coat all around the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add solder into the end of the 2 mm connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remelt the solder in the connector and at the end of the wire at the same time and push the wire into the connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the wire straight until the solder solidifies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut a piece of heatshrink that is slightly larger in diameter than the wire and the connector.
Use red heatshrink for red wires and black for black wires.
Heatshrink should cover all the conductive parts when the connector is connected
and about 5 mm or more of the wire insulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the heatshrink onto the connector and heat it with hot air.
Suitable temperature is around 150 - 200 degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some solder to a pad on the PCB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the end of the wire onto the pads and remelt the solder on the pad and at the end of the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the wire in place until the solder has solidified.</p>
