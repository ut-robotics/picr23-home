<p>You need to solder the power wires and connectors to the test mainboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Cut 5 pairs of red and black 18 AWG wire.
The pieces of wire can be about 5 cm long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strip about 5 mm of insulation from each end of the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightly twist the strands of the wire at each end to prevent the strands from separating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some flux to the ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover the ends with some solder.
Make sure to evenly coat all around the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add solder into the ends of the 2 mm connectors and XT30 connectors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remelt the solder in the connector and at the end of the wire and push the wire into the connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the wire straight until the solder solidifies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cut pieces of heatshrink that are slightly larger in diameter than the wire and the connectors.
Red heatshrink for red wire and black for black wire.
Heatshrink should cover all the conductive parts when the connector is connected and about 5 mm of the wire insulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the heatshrink onto the connector and heat it with hot air.
Suitable temperature is around 150 - 200 degrees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add some solder to the pads on the PCB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place the end of the wire onto the pads and remelt the solder on the pad and at the end of the wire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the wire in place until the solder has solidified.</p>
</li>
