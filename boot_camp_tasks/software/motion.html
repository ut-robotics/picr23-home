<li>
<p>Open <code>main.py</code>.
This file contains an example implementation of the image processor and motion classes.
<strong>For this task in case of questions, ask an instructor.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a main loop that processes every camera frame
and outputs a <code>ProcessedResults</code> object that contains information about objects detected in the frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the return data to find if there are any balls in the frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are balls in the frame, <strong>find the largest balls Object.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find the X and Y coordinates of the ball.</strong>
Take into consideration that the zero coordinates of the frame are in the upper left corner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using these coordinates calculate the rotation for the robot to turn towards the ball.
Use <code>PrintingMotion</code> and its move method print the direction the robot is turning.
If the directiction is opposite to what you expect, you can set the <code>polarity</code> variable to -1 to invert it. Teh default is 1.
Write code so that <strong>the robot centers the ball horizontally</strong>.
<strong>Don&#8217;t only use constant speeds</strong> since it leads to jerky motion.
Try to implement a proportional system where the robot turns faster when the ball is further away from the center and slower when closer, stopping when centered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demo your solution to the instructors.
Iterate on the solution in case deficiencies are brought up by instructors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If everything works, continue to the next task.</p>
